## Usage

## Using the Java Jsoup Crawler

This project includes a Java Jsoup crawler to simplify the process of obtaining real data from JD. Jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. To leverage the crawler, follow these steps:

1. **Explore the Crawler Code:**
   - Navigate to the [`CrawlerService`](path/to/CrawlerService.java) class in the source code.
   - Review the methods to understand how data is fetched and processed.

2. **Configure Crawler Settings:**
   - Adjust the crawler settings such as URL, timeout, or data extraction logic according to your requirements. These settings can be found in the crawler service implementation.

3. **Initiate Crawling:**
   - Call the `parseContent` method in the `ContentService` class with the desired keyword:
     ```java
     GET http://localhost:your_port/parse/{keyword}
     ```
     This will trigger the crawler to fetch real data from JD based on the specified keyword.

4. **Customize Data Processing:**
   - If needed, modify the data processing logic in the crawler service to suit your specific use case.

By utilizing the Java Jsoup crawler, you can seamlessly integrate real data from JD into your ElasticSearch index. Feel free to explore and customize the crawler to meet your project's requirements.

This API will save the keywords to the index, with each call fetching 30 products.

## Searching

To perform a search, you have two options:

1. **Search Bar on Index Page:**
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:your_port/](http://localhost:your_port/) on your browser.
   - Use the search bar available on the index page to enter your keywords.
   - The search results will be displayed directly on the web page.

2. **Search API:**
   - Alternatively, you can use the following API for programmatic search:
     ```java
     // Search for items with highlights
     GET http://localhost:your_port/search/{keyword}/{pageNo}/{pageSize}
     ```
   - Replace `{keyword}`, `{pageNo}`, and `{pageSize}` with your search parameters.
   - This API returns the search results with highlights.

Choose the method that best fits your needsâ€”whether you prefer a user-friendly interface with the search bar on the index page or direct programmatic access using the API.

This API retrieves item information with highlights enabled, providing users with a rich search experience.

### Tips
